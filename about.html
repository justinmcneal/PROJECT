            believe that collaboration is the key aspect of a team to success. Established on January 19, 2024, 
            this group of IT students commenced their academic journey, as a united front, brimming with enthusiasm 
            and a shared vision for excellence. As they received their project assignment on February 2, 2024, with 
            passion and courage, the team has committed wholeheartedly, investing their time, using their skills and 
            resources in order to earn the enthusiasm of the students and future learners with this project. Our 
            mission is to help users identify the facilities around PHIMNA-University of Pangasinan Dagupan Campus, 
            as we, the developers have (also been lost during our enrollment as a first year) found that this was the 
            anser to an experience most of us had as first-time students at the university. This has been a long journey. 
            Encouraging each other's personal development and fostering a culture of unwavering support, laying the 
            groundwork for collaborative success as we navigate the dynamic landscape of technology together.
